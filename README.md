## What is nextGPU?​
nextGPU is a decentralized computing power network platform dedicated to providing computational support for AI workflows. It aggregates idle GPU resources from the market, processes them through interconnection, interoperability, and performance measurement, and constructs an efficient hardware infrastructure for AI workflows. When users submit AI task requests, nextGPU intelligently dispatches tasks to the most suitable GPU computing nodes for execution and returns processed results to users.

## How do I earn money on nextGPU as a computing power provider?​
nextGPU’s core service leverages decentralized idle computing resources. Therefore, when users pay computing power fees, the platform retains only a 15% service fee and makes the remaining 85% payment directly to providers. As a provider, you can withdraw your earnings at any time (periodically or flexibly) from the platform.

## What are the advantages of using nextGPU?
nextGPU’s core advantage is its ​highly competitive pricing. By leveraging idle computing resources, its operational costs are ​significantly lower than competitors.
Example: Generating a 1024x1024 image with 20 steps costs ​CN¥0.1​ on alternative platforms, whereas nextGPU charges only ​CN¥0.0023​ – approximately ​1/43 (or 2.3%)​​ of the standard cost.

## How does nextGPU ensure complete output for AI tasks?
nextGPU differs from conventional decentralized platforms through:

1. Rigorous Node Screening：
Each computing node ​undergoes real-task benchmarking​ using actual AI workloads. Nodes failing benchmark tests are ​flagged as "disqualified"​​ and excluded from task scheduling.

2. Intelligent Task Monitoring & Retry：
Real-time execution monitoring tracks each AI task. If a task exceeds its expected completion window (typically indicating node instability), the system:
* ​Immediately redirects​ the task to qualified backup nodes
* ​Temporarily disables​ the underperforming node

## How does nextGPU guarantee efficient workflow execution?
The platform maximizes efficiency via ​intelligent task orchestration:

1. Workflow Decomposition:​​ Analyzes AI workflow structures beyond simple task distribution
2. ​Parallelization Engine:​​ Automatically splits tasks into parallelizable subtasks
3. Dynamic Dispatching:​​ Intelligently distributes subtasks across optimal idle nodes

This approach delivers ​**≥3.9× acceleration**​ for AI tasks while optimizing idle GPU utilization.
